# react-native-dir-convention - Directory Organization Convention for React Native Projects
A few studies focus on the file and directory organization of react-native projects though every developer has her/his own styles.

You can refer the following studies I compiled for you (thanks to the authors):
- [Organizing a React Native Project](https://medium.com/the-react-native-log/organizing-a-react-native-project-9514dfadaa0): A very comprehensive review by Spencer Carli (Jul 2016).
- [React native project setup — a better folder structure](https://medium.com/@chenzhe142/manage-react-native-project-folder-structure-and-simplify-the-code-c98da77ef792): The "DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself" approach by Zhe Chen (Sep 2016).
* [How to structure your react app](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-structure-your-react-app-98c48e102aad): An organization approach by Ven Korolyov (May 2018).
- [How To Structure a React Native App For Scale](https://medium.com/the-andela-way/how-to-structure-a-react-native-app-for-scale-a29194cd33fc): Another organization including fastlane by Anosike Osifo (Jan 2018).
- [React Native ile İlginç Bilgiler Uygulaması, 'BiBilgi' Açık Kaynak Projesi](http://www.avarekodcu.com/konu/25/react-native-ile-ilginc-bilgiler-uygulamasi-bibilgi-acik-kaynak-projesi): Another proposal by Abdurrahman Eker in Turkish (Nov 2017).

I have been developing this file/directory organization convention that is based on my experience and will be matured by my practices.

The convention is not solely for presenting a directory hieararchy, but also includes some organized development techniques such as error displaying, styles, and preparing package.json for local directories in order to eliminate "../../" style relative paths in importing modules.

There are some recommended approaches presented in the files such as Settings.js for storing run-time and/or persistent preference settings of a mobile application.

I would like to receive your feedbacks and contributions, too.
